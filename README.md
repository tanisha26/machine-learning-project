# Car Insurance Claim Project

This project aims to analyze car insurance claim data to predict claims and gain insights from the dataset.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:  
[Car Insurance Claims Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/warazubairkhan/car-insurrance-claims-analysis)


## Files in this Project:
- `car_insurance_claim.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `Copy_of_Untitled0.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with the analysis and model implementation.
- `final_numeric_car_df.csv`: A preprocessed version of the dataset.
- `Tanisha ML.Rmd`: RMarkdown file with additional analysis.

## Project Overview:
- The dataset contains car insurance claim data that is used to predict whether a claim will be made.
- The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models.

## How to Run the Code:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Copy_of_Untitled0.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
3. To view the R analysis, open the `Tanisha ML.Rmd` file in an RMarkdown-compatible environment.
